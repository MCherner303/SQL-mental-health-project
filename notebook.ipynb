A Japanese international university surveyed its students in 2018 and published a study the following year that was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.\n\nThe study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties than the general population, and that social connectedness (belonging to a social group) and acculturative stress (stress associated with joining a new culture) are predictive of depression.\n\n\nExplore the `students` data using PostgreSQL to find out if you would come to a similar conclusion for international students and see if the length of stay is a contributing factor.\n\nHere is a data description of the columns you may find helpful.","metadata":{},"id":"dbd633ea-2c0a-4bac-a6fe-0cc86896162b","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"| Field Name    | Description                                      |\n| ------------- |

the mental health data for international and domestic students, two key factors emerged as strong predictors of depression among international students: social connectedness and acculturative stress.\n\nSocial connectedness showed a moderate to strong negative correlation with depression scores (correlation = -0.5518), indicating that students who feel more socially integrated and connected experience significantly lower levels of depression.\nAcculturative stress demonstrated a moderate positive correlation with depression scores (correlation = 0.3941), suggesting that students who face greater challenges adapting to the new culture are more likely to suffer from higher depression levels.\nIn contrast, other variables like language proficiency (both in English and Japanese) and length of stay showed very weak or negligible correlations with depression, indicating that these factors alone are not significant predictors of mental health outcomes in this context.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nThe findings highlight the importance of fostering social connections and addressing acculturative stress in supporting the mental health of international students. Programs aimed at reducing cultural adjustment difficulties and building strong social networks may significantly reduce depression rates among this vulnerable group.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"988118bf-7fdc-4af8-8a5c-db4137fead14"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
